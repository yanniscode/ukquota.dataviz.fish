## Test Pages

The test pages in this folder serve two purposes:

1. Demonstrate a specific feature of the directives and services with the bare minimum code (i.e. no Bootstrap, no extra module dependencies like ngRouter, etc)
2. To be run by the e2e test specs when you execute `gulp test`

These pages are served along with the docs site when you run the `gulp` task and are accessible from the root (i.e. `http://localhost:9002/feature-layer.html`).

You may notice that most of these test pages have corresponding the examples in the docs site. You can expect test pages that have corresponding e2e test specs to be up to date.
