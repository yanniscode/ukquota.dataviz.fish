#### Steps to reproduce the behavior

**We can only help you if we're able to reproduce the behavior you describe above.** Please provide:

1. Steps to reproduce the behavior
2. A link to an app where we can carry out those steps (either our example pages, your publicly facing app, or a Plunker, JSFiddle, JSBin, etc)
3. Relevant code snippet(s) (only if not easily obtained from the above link)

We've created Plunkers that you can use as a starting point if the bug does not show in our example pages, or your app is not publicly accessible:
- [Start here](https://plnkr.co/edit/tvyKCU?p=preview) if using v1 (Esri JSAPI 3.x)
- [Start here](https://plnkr.co/edit/UGv7v5?p=preview) if using v2 (Esri JSAPI 4.x)

Be sure to save your edits and save and include the link to your live sample in this issue description.
