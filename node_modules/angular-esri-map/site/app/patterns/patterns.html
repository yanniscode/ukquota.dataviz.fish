<h2>Patterns</h2>
<p>You have probably noticed that there are very few directives and services included here. In fact, there are even fewer that we included in <a href="https://arcgis.github.io/angular-esri-map-site-v1/">version 1</a>. The reason for this is that the latest version of this library targets version 4 of the <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/">ArcGIS API for JavaScript</a>, which does a better job of seperating concerns between views and models. This makes it easier to use many of the Esri modules directly within an Angular application.
</p>
<p>For this reason, we have focused on providing only the minimal set of re-usable directives and services required to make it easy to use the ArcGIS API for JavaScript in your Angular 1 apps. If your application has modest mapping needs, these directives and services may be all you need.</p>
<p>If your application makes use of some of the more advanced capabilities of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, then the directives and examples in this repository will also demonstrate the following patterns that will help you extend what we've provided to meet the needs of your application.</p>
<ul>
    <li ng-repeat="page in patternsPages"><a ng-href="{{'#' + page.path}}">{{ page.title }}</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The above patterns demonstrate how you can extend what we've provided in this library to meet the needs of any application.</p>
