        <h2>Loading and Using Other Esri Classes</h2>
        <p>Much of the work involved in creating a map and loading, styling, and managing its layers happens outside of the declarative directive APIs that we have provided here. So we've provided a way for you to load the modules (such as renderers, symbols, toolbars, task, etc.) that you'll need to accomplish those tasks. The <a href="./docs/#/api/esri.core.factory:esriLoader">esriLoader</a> service helps you load and use those modules.</p>
        <p>Just about <a href="#/examples">every example</a> we've provided demonstrates this pattern.</p>
